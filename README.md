swift-compiler-crashes
======================

This repo collects known test cases crashing the Swift compiler. All tests cases in the `crashes/` directory are known to generate a compiler crash under Xcode6-Beta6 when being compiled.

Help us towards a rock solid Swift compiler by contributing any compiler crashes you may encounter.

Happy Swifting! :-)
